<p align="justify">Implementation of various path-finding algorithms, namely Djikstra, BFS, DFS & Best First Search to find the shortest path from source to
destination in mazes. Pathfinding algorithms address the problem of finding a path from a source to a destination avoiding obstacles and minimizing the costs (time, distance, risks, fuel, price, etc.).
<br><br>
Mazes can be manually created or can be automatically generated by our algorithm. The tech stack used to create this project is C++ and SFML (one of its graphics libraries).
<br><br>
It also outputs the step-by-step path from the source to the destination in the logs with the number of iterations(or steps) it took the selected algorithm to 
reach the destination. This helps in analysis and comparison of each of these algorithms.
